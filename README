Instructions to run:

Download the main.py file and navigate to it in Visual Studio Code or a terminal/Windows command prompt.

Opening the file in Visual Studio Code is the preferred method, as it seems that the time comparisons don't work in certain cases
in the terminal, executes too quickly, and records the time as zero. All of the cases should work 100% correctly when run in Visual Studio Code.

Make sure that you have python installed on your computer. I can be downloaded from https://www.python.org/

Instructions for Visual Studio Code:
Once the file has been loaded, click the start arrow in the top right of the page.
A terminal should open at the bottom and the output of the code can be viewed.

Instructions for terminal/Windows command prompt:
Once you have navigated to the file, run the command "python main.py".
You should then be able to view the output of running the command.
